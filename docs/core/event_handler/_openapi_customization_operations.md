Customize your API endpoints by adding metadata to endpoint definitions.

Here's a breakdown of various customizable fields:

| Field Name             | Type                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `summary`              | `str`                                   | A concise overview of the main functionality of the endpoint. This brief introduction is usually displayed in autogenerated API documentation and helps consumers quickly understand what the endpoint does.                                                                                                               |
| `description`          | `str`                                   | A more detailed explanation of the endpoint, which can include information about the operation's behavior, including side effects, error states, and other operational guidelines.                                                                                                                                         |
| `responses`            | `Dict[int, Dict[str, OpenAPIResponse]]` | A dictionary that maps each HTTP status code to a Response Object as defined by the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/#response-object). This allows you to describe expected responses, including default or error messages, and their corresponding schemas or models for different status codes. |
| `response_description` | `str`                                   | Provides the default textual description of the response sent by the endpoint when the operation is successful. It is intended to give a human-readable understanding of the result.                                                                                                                                       |
| `tags`                 | `List[str]`                             | Tags are a way to categorize and group endpoints within the API documentation. They can help organize the operations by resources or other heuristic.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `operation_id`         | `str`                                   | A unique identifier for the operation, which can be used for referencing this operation in documentation or code. This ID must be unique across all operations described in the API.                                                                                                                                       |
| `include_in_schema`    | `bool`                                  | A boolean value that determines whether or not this operation should be included in the OpenAPI schema. Setting it to `False` can hide the endpoint from generated documentation and schema exports, which might be useful for private or experimental endpoints.                                                          |
| `deprecated`           | `bool`                                   | A boolean value that determines whether or not this operation should be marked as deprecated in the OpenAPI schema.                                                             |
